# Matter

- Anything that has mass and occupies space
- Chemistry is the study of matter

# Observations

- **Qualitative observation:** no numbers, e.g., that shirt is red, the solution is warm to the touch
- **Quantitative observation:** taken using a measuring device, e.g., the thermometer measures $\pu{21.5 \pm 0.5 \degree C}$, the $\ce{[CO2]}$ was measured to be 500 ppm in the room using the Aranet $\ce{[CO2]}$ monitor

## Interpretations 

- Inference based on an observation, adds meaning to the observation
- E.g., a $\ce{[CO2]}$ of 500 ppm means the ventilation is pretty good

# Kinetic Molecular Theory

- All matter is made up of tiny particles
- There is empty space between particles
- Particles are always moving (unless at absolute zero Kelvin)
	- Their degree of freedom to move depends on their state
- Particles move because they have energy
- Amount of energy particles have determine how fast and how far they will move

# Physical and chemical properties

## Physical properties

- A characteristic of a substance that can be observed/measured without changing its identity
- E.g., color, hardness, malleability, solubility, electrical conductivity, density

**Evidence of physical change:**
- Typically reversible
- Change in size of shape
- Change in phase

Energy changes usually do not accompany physical changes, except in phase changes and when a substance dissolves.

## Intensive and extensive physical properties

> [!important] Key Point

**Extensive physical properties** depend on the amount of substance present (mass, volume.)

**Intensive physical properties** depend only on the nature of the substance, not how much is present (e.g., density, melting point, boiling point.) Intensive properties are useful for differentiating different pure substances.

## Chemical properties

- Substance's potential to undergo chemical change or reaction
- Describes relationship between substance and other forms of matter
- E.g., flammability, toxicity, acidity

**Evidence of chemical change:**
- Light or heat is given off
- Bubbles formed
- Color changes
- Precipitate forms
- Difficult to reverse

# Types of kinetic energy

Three types of kinetic energy a molecule can possess:
1. **Rotational energy:** causes a molecule to rotate about an axis (frisbee)
2. **Vibrational energy:** causes the length of a bond to change (slinky)
3. **Translational energy:** causes a molecule to move about in space (throw a ball). When a substance is heated, translational energy causes bonds to break.

# States of matter

**Temperature and pressure** affect which state matter is in. As the temperature increases, average kinetic energy increases as well so the particles vibrate/rotate/translate more.

> [!info] Definition of Heat and Temperature
> - **Heat:** measure of the energy transferred from a hot body to a colder one
> - **Temperature:** measure of the average kinetic energy of the atom or molecules in a system.

## Solid

- Fixed volume
- Fixed shape
- Cannot be compressed
- Attractive forces between particles hold them in close-packed arrangement
- Particles vibrate in fixed positions

## Liquid

- Fixed volume
- No fixed shape -- takes shape of container it occupies
- Cannot be compressed
- Forces between particles are weaker than in solids
- Particles vibrate, rotate, and translate (move around)

## Gas

- No fixed volume
- No fixed shape -- expands to occupy available shape
- Can be compressed
- Forces between particles are taken as zero
- Particles vibrate, rotate, and translate faster than in a liquid

## Heating curve of water

![[water-heating-curve.png]]

> [!important] Temperature during phase changes
> Note that the temperature does not change while the water is boiling/melting. This is because energy is constantly being used to overcome the attractive forces between the molecules, meaning that the kinetic energy does not change.

**Heat of fusion:** $\Delta \ce{H^{\circ}_{fus}}$ Amount of heat required to convert solid at its melting point into a liquid without an increase in temperature.

**Heat of vaporization:** $\Delta \ce{H^{\circ}_{vap}}$ Amount of heat required to transform a given quantity of substance into a gas at a given pressure. Difference in potential energy between liquid and gas states without an increase in temperature.

> [!note] Why is $\Delta \ce{H^{\circ}_{fus}} \gg \Delta \ce{H^{\circ}_{vap}}$?
> It takes more energy to convert water from liquid to gas than from solid to liquid.
