# Matter

- Anything that has mass and occupies space
- Chemistry is the study of matter

# Observations

- **Qualitative observation:** no numbers, e.g., that shirt is red, the solution is warm to the touch
- **Quantitative observation:** taken using a measuring device, e.g., the thermometer measures $\pu{21.5 \pm 0.5 \degree C}$, the $\ce{[CO2]}$ was measured to be 500 ppm in the room using the Aranet $\ce{[CO2]}$ monitor

## Interpretations 

- Inference based on an observation, adds meaning to the observation
- E.g., a $\ce{[CO2]}$ of 500 ppm means the ventilation is pretty good

# Kinetic Molecular Theory

- All matter is made up of tiny particles
- There is empty space between particles
- Particles are always moving (unless at absolute zero Kelvin)
	- Their degree of freedom to move depends on their state
- Particles move because they have energy
- Amount of energy particles have determine how fast and how far they will move

# Energy

Three types of kinetic energy a molecule can possess:
1. **Rotational energy:** causes a molecule to rotate about an axis (frisbee)
2. **Vibrational energy:** causes the length of a bond to change (slinky)
3. **Translational energy:** causes a molecule to move about in space (throw a ball). When a substance is heated, translational energy causes bonds to break.

If a substance is continually heated, a phase change may occur.

- **Heat:** measure of the energy transferred from a hot body to a colder one.
- **Temperature:** measure of the average kinetic energy of the atom or molecules in a system.

# States of matter

Three most common states are solid, liquid, and gas.

There is a fourth state of matter, plasma, that has all the properties of a gas except that it is composed of charged particles. E.g., northern lights, lightning, fusion reactors, Tesla coils, neon lights, the Sun.

**Temperature and pressure** affect which state matter is in.

## Solid

- Fixed shape and volume so all particles are in direct contact with each other
- Not compressible
- Very small change in volume when heated or subjected to pressure
- Possess vibrational energy only

## Liquid

- Fixed volume but takes the shape of the container
- Particles in close contact with each other and can slide past one another but are not compressible
- Possess vibrational and rotational energy

## Gas

- Takes shape and volume of container
- Highly compressible because particles are widely separated and only contact each other during collisions
- Volume drastically altered by changing temperature and pressure
- Possess vibrational, rotational, and translational energy

# Heating and cooling curve of water

![[water-heating-curve.png | 400]]

1. **Heat of fusion:** $\Delta \ce{H^{\circ}_{fus}}$ Amount of heat required to convert solid at its melting point into a liquid without an increase in temperature.
2. **Heat of vaporization:** $\Delta \ce{H^{\circ}_{vap}}$ Amount of heat required to transform a given quantity of substance into a gas at a given pressure. Difference in potential energy between liquid and gas states without an increase in temperature.

> [!note] Why is $\Delta \ce{H^{\circ}_{fus}} \gg \Delta \ce{H^{\circ}_{vap}}$?
> It takes more energy to convert water from liquid to gas than from solid to liquid.

> [!note] Why doesn't temperature change during a phase change?
> Energy is used to change phase. Once phase is the same, temperature will increase again.

# Melting point

An intensive property unique to that substance if pure.

- Measure of the strength of attractive forces (bonds and forces between molecules) and mass/symmetry of the particles
- Temperature at which solid changes to liquid
- Freezing point is same temperature

# Boiling point

An intensive property, unique to that substance if pure.

- Highest temperature in the liquid state at a given pressure
- Condensation point is same temperature
- Substances that are volatile will easily evaporate
	- Have high vapor pressures and low boiling points
