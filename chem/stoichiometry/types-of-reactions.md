# Types of Chemical Reactions

## Synthesis

In a synthesis (aka combination) reaction, **two or more substances combine to form a single new substance**. The general form is:
$$\ce{A + B -> AB}$$
An example is solid sodium metal reacting with chlorine gas to produce solid sodium chloride: $$\ce{2Na_{(s)} + Cl2_{(g)} -> 2NaCl_{(s)}}.$$

## Decomposition

In a decomposition reaction, a compound **breaks down into two or more simpler substances**. The general form is: $$\ce{AB -> A + B}.$$
An example is mercury(II) oxide decomposing when heated to produce mercury and oxygen gas: $$\ce{2HgO_{(s)} -> 2Hg_{(l)} + O2_{(g)}}.$$

> Most decomposition reactions require an input of energy (heat, light, or electricity.)

# Single Replacement

In a single replacement reaction, **one element replaces a similar element in a compound**. The general form is: $$\ce{A + BC -> AC + B}.$$
There are three types of single replacement reactions, as follows:
- **Metal replacement**, e.g., $$\ce{Mg_{(s)} + Cu(NO3)2_{(aq)} -> Mg(NO3)2_{(aq)} + Cu_{(s)}}$$
- **Hydrogen replacement**, e.g., $$\ce{Zn_{(s)} + 2HCl_{(aq)} -> ZnCl2_{(aq)} + H2_{(g)}}$$
	- Some metals are capable of replacing hydrogen in water, producing a metal hydroxide and hydrogen gas. For example, sodium reacts with water to produce aqueous sodium hydroxide and hydrogen: $$\ce{2Na_{(s)} + 2H2O_{(l)} -> 2NaOH_{(aq)} + H2_{(g)}}$$
* **Halogen replacement**, e.g., $$\ce{Cl2_{(g)} + 2NaBr_{(aq)} -> 2NaCl_{(aq)} + Br2_{(l)}}$$

## Predicting Single Replacement Reactions

To predict the products of a single replacement reaction,
1. Determine which elements will swap places.
	- Elements will generally attempt to replace similar elements, so anions will replace anions and cations will replace cations.
2. Check whether the reaction will occur using reactivity series.
	- More reactive elements will replace less reactive elements. The reverse is not true.

_Solution._ We know that $\ce{Cl}$ will swap with either $\ce{K}$ or $\ce{I}$; as $\ce{Cl}$ is an anion, we expect it to replace $\ce{I}$.

Looking at the anion reactivity series $\ce{F2 > Cl2 > Br2 > I2}$, we find that $\ce{Cl}$ is indeed more reactive than $\ce{I}$ and so the reaction will occur. Thus, the answer is
$$\ce{2KI_{(aq)} + Cl2_{(aq)} -> 2KCl_{(aq)} + I2_{(s)}}.$$

# Double Replacement

In a double replacement reaction, **cations and anions switch partners** to form two new products. The general form is: $$\ce{AB + CD -> AD + CB}.$$
An example is aqueous hydrochloric acid reacting with aqueous sodium hydroxide to form aqueous sodium chloride and water: $$\ce{HCl_{(aq)} + NaOH_{(aq)} -> NaCl_{(aq)} + H2O_{(l)}}.$$

# Neutralization

In a neutralization reaction, **an acid and a base react to produce a salt and water.** The general is thus: $$\ce{acid + base = salt + water}.$$
An example is the reaction between hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide: $$\ce{HCl_{(aq)} + NaOH_{(aq)} -> NaCl_{(aq)} + H2O_{(l)}}.$$

# Combustion

In a combustion reaction, **a substance reacts with oxygen gas, releasing energy in the form of light and heat.** The general form is: $$\ce{C_{x}H_{y} + O2 -> XCO2 + \frac{Y}{2}H2O}.$$
