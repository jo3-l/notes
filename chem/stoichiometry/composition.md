# Percent Composition

Percentage of a species (atoms, ion, molecule) in a chemical formula by mass.

To calculate:

1. Calculate molar mass of compound/molecule.
2. Calculate molar mass of species within compound/molecule.
3. Plug into formula:
   $$\text{percent composition} = \frac{\text{molar mass of species}}{\text{molar mass of compound/molecule}} \times 100\%$$

# Types of Formulas

- **Empirical formula (EF):** simplest ratio of different types of atoms in compound. E.g., empirical formula for $\ce{C6H6}$ is $\ce{CH}$.
- **Molecular formula (MF):** actual number of each type of atom in each molecule
- **Structural formula (SF):** shows how the atoms in a molecule are arranged and how atoms are connected

Molecules with same MF but different SF are called isomers.

Ionic compounds have EF, and their SF are lattices.

Covalent compounds have EF, MF, SF. Ethene ($\ce{C2H4}$), propane $\ce{C2H6}$, butene ($\ce{C4H8}$) all have an EF of $\ce{CH2}$ but different MF and EF.
