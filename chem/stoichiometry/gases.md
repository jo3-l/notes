# General Characteristics

- Will expand to fit container they are in
- Can be compressed (lots of space between particles)
- Collide with walls of container creating pressure ($\pu{kPa}$, $\pu{bar}$, $\pu{atm}$)
- Can be measured in volume ($\pu{mL}$, $\pu{L}$, $\pu{cm^3}$), mass ($\pu{g}$), or moles ($\pu{mol}$)

# Avogadro's Law

Equal volumes of different gases at the same temperature and pressure contain the same number of particles.

A consequence of Avogadro's hypothesis is that 2L of $\ce{H2}$, $\ce{He}$, $\ce{Ne}$, $\ce{N2}$ **all contain the same number of particles!**

# Ideal Gas Law

> [!info]
> Gases are _ideal_ if their collisions are elastic and do not result in chemical reaction products (i.e., particles can collide but do not create products.)
>
> Gases behave ideally under conditions of high temperature and low pressure.

The Ideal Gas Law states

$$PV = nRT$$

where:

- $P$ is the pressure in $\pu{kPa}$
- $V$ is the volume in $\pu{L}$
- $n$ is the number of moles
- $R$ is the ideal gas constant $\pu{8.31 L kPa mol^-1 K^-1}$
- $T$ is the temperature in $\pu{K}$

## Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP)

* Defined as $\pu{273K}$ and $\pu{100.00 kPa}$.

> [!info]
> At STP, one mole of any gas has a volume of $\pu{22.7L}$. (We obtain this value by plugging in the pressure and temperature into the ideal gas equation.)
>
> The mass of $\pu{22.7L}$ of a gas at STP in grams is numerically equal to its molar mass in $\pu{g/mol}$.

## Standard Ambient Temperature and Pressure (SATP)

- Same pressure as STP ($\pu{100.00 kPa}$), but higher temperature ($\pu{298K}$)

# Densities

If volume of a solid or liquid is unknown, calculate volume using

$$v = m/\rho$$

If density is unknown, use mass and volume to calculate

$$\rho = m/v$$

> [!tip]
> If neither mass nor volume is known, you may be able to use the molar mass and molar volume at STP.
