# Precipitate Phases

When two aqueous solutions are mixed, they may react to form a precipitate (s) or water (l).

> [!important]
> The only true products of a double-replacement reaction are liquid water and precipitates (solid or water).

To predict the phase of products in double replacement reactions, use the solubility table (will be provided on any exams requiring it):

1. Determine the anion present in the salt.
2. Look up the anion in the solubility table and hence find the solubility.
	- Low solubility means that a precipitate (solid) will form.

> [!example]
> Predict the product(s) of $\ce{Na2S_{(aq)} + AgNO3_{(aq)}}$.

_Solution._ We know that the reaction will be
$$\ce{Na2S_{(aq)} + 2AgNO3_{(aq)} -> 2NaNO3 + Ag2S}$$
First consider $\ce{NaNO3}$, in which the anion is $\ce{NO3}$. Looking this up in the solubility table, we find that the compound containing $\ce{NO3}$ and $\ce{Na}$ is soluble. Thus, $\ce{NaNO3}$ will be aqueous and is therefore not a precipitate.

Next consider $\ce{Ag2S}$, in which the anion is $\ce{S}$. Looking this up in the solubility table, we find that the compound containing $\ce{Ag}$ and $\ce{S}$ has low solubility. Thus, $\ce{Ag2S}$ will be a solid and is therefore a precipitate.

Putting it all together, we have
$$\ce{Na2S_{(aq)} + 2AgNO3_{(aq)} -> 2NaNO3_{(aq)} + \underbrace{Ag2S_{(s)}}_{precipitate}}$$

# Total Ionic Equations

> [!info] Definition
> In a total ionic equation, all ionic species are shown in their disassociated forms, while solids and liquids stay as is.

> [!example]
> Write the total ionic equation for $$\ce{2AgF_{(aq)} + MgSO4_{(aq)} -> Ag2SO4_{(s)} + MgF2_{(aq)}}.$$

_Solution._ We break all the aqueous species into their disassociated forms, leaving the precipitate $\ce{Ag2SO4}$ as is:
$$
\begin{gather*}
\ce{2Ag^+_{(aq)} + 2F^-_{(aq)} + Mg^2+_{(aq)} + SO4^2-_{(aq)} \\ -> 2SO4_{(s)} + Mg^2+_{(aq)} + 2F^-_{(aq)}}
\end{gather*}
$$

# Net Ionic Equations

> [!info]
> The net ionic equation can be found by taking the total ionic equation and cancelling common species on both sides.

Consider the previous example. Cancelling common species in the net ionic equation, we have
$$
\begin{gather*}
\ce{2Ag^+_{(aq)} + $\cancel{\ce{2F^-_{(aq)}}}$ + $\cancel{\ce{Mg^2+_{(aq)}}}$ + SO4^2-_{(aq)} \\ -> 2SO4_{(s)} + ${\cancel{\ce{Mg^2+_{(aq)}}}}$ + ${\cancel{\ce{2F^-_{(aq)}}}}$}
\end{gather*}
$$
so the net ionic equation is
$$\ce{2Ag^+_{(aq)} + SO4^2-_{(aq)} -> 2SO4_{(s)}}.$$
