## Enthalpy

Enthalpy (denoted $H$) is the measure of the heat content in a system.

> [!important]
> Enthalpy cannot be measured directly; however, the **change** in enthalpy ($\Delta H$) _can_ be measured.

# Energy Exchange in Chemical Reactions

- Energy stored in chemical bonds is potential energy
- In chemical reactions, bonds are broken/formed, leading to a change in energy and thus enthalpy

**Energy exchange can be represented using:**
- $\Delta H$ notation, where $$\Delta H = \text{sum of } H_{\text{products}} - \text{sum of } H_{\text{reactants}}$$
- Thermochemical equation, where the heat term is written like a typical reactant/product, e.g., $$\ce{28H18 + 25O2 -> 16CO2 + 18H2O + \pu{5076 kJ}}$$

# Endothermic Reactions

In an **endothermic** reaction, heat is transferred from the surroundings into the system. Consequently:
- $\Delta H$ is positive (and so the heat term is written on the left side);
- Surroundings feel cooler relative to the system;
- Products will be higher than reactants on an energy diagram.

# Exothermic Reactions

In an **exothermic** reaction, heat is transferred from the system into the surroundings. Consequently:
- $\Delta H$ is negative (and so the heat term is written on the right side);
- Surroundings feel warmer relative to the system;
- Products will be lower than reactants on an energy diagram.

# Calculations with Enthalpy

> [!example]
> Calculate the amount of heat released in $\pu{kJ}$ when $\pu{1.26 \times 10^4 mg}$ of ammonia is produced according to the following equation: $$\ce{N2 + 3H2 -> 2NH3} \qquad \Delta H = \pu{-92.6kJ mol^{-1}}.$$

_Solution._ First, calculate the amount of ammonia produced in $\pu{mol}$: $$\pu{1.26 \times 10^4 mg} \times \frac{\pu{1g}}{\pu{10^3mg}} \times \frac{\pu{1 mol}}{\pu{17.04g}} \approx \pu{0.739 mol}$$
Now, consider the corresponding thermochemical equation: $$\ce{N2 + 3H2 -> 2NH3 + \pu{92.6 kJ}}$$
Evidently, for every $\pu{2 mol}$ of $\ce{NH3}$, $\pu{92.6kJ}$ of heat will be released, so the final answer is $$\pu{0.739mol} \times \frac{\pu{92.6kJ}}{\pu{2 mol}} \approx \boxed{\pu{34.2 kJ} \text{ of heat released}}.$$
