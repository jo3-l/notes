# Ionic Compounds

> [!info]
> An ionic compound is typically composed of a metal and a non-metal.

## Formula From Name

1. Write the name of the cation (typically a metal.)
   E.g., in  $\ce{NaCl}$, we would write "sodium" first.

   If the ion is multivalent, then use Roman numerals between the cation and anion to represent the charge.

   E.g., in $\ce{MnO2}$, manganese is multivalent. As $\ce{O}$ has a $-2$ charge, the charge on $\ce{Mn}$ must be $+4$ and so we the name of the metal is manganese (IV.)

2. Write the name of the anion (typically a non-metal) with the suffix -ide added to the end.
   E.g., in $\ce{NaCl}$, chlorine becomes chloride.

> Do not change the names of polyatomic ions. E.g., $\ce{(NH4)2SO4}$ should be ammonium sulfate.

### List of Common Polyatomic Ions

| Compound       | Name         |
| -------------- | ------------ |
| $\ce{H2CO3^-}$ | bicarbonate  |
| $\ce{CO3^2-}$  | carbonate    |
| $\ce{CN^-}$    | cyanide      |
| $\ce{OH^-}$    | hydroxide    |
| $\ce{NO3^-}$   | nitrate      |
| $\ce{NO2^-}$   | nitrite      |
| $\ce{C2O4^2-}$ | oxalate      |
| $\ce{ClO4^-}$  | perchlorate  |
| $\ce{MnO4^-}$  | permanganate |
| $\ce{SO4^2-}$  | sulfate      |
| $\ce{SO3^2-}$  | sulfite      |
| $\ce{SCN^-}$$  | thiocyanate  |

### Examples

| Compound         | Name                 |
| ---------------- | -------------------- |
| $\ce{CoCl2}$     | cobalt (II) chloride |
| $\ce{Pb(CO3)2}$  | lead (IV) carbonate  |
| $\ce{(NH4)2SO4}$ | ammonium sulfate     |

## Name From Formula

1. Write both ions with their charges.
2. Balance the charges to get a neutral compound.

E.g., given magnesium chloride, we know that the two ions are $\ce{Mg^2+}$ and $\ce{Cl^-}$. Balancing gives us $\ce{MgCl2}$.

> [!note] Multivalent Ions
> To determine the charge of a multivalent ion in an ionic compound, look at the roman numeral after it.
>
> E.g., if in gold (III) bromide, the charge of the gold ion is $+3$ and hence we have $\ce{AuBr3}$.

# Ionics Solids Containing Water

When a crystal of an inorganic compound is grown by evaporation, it is often found that the crystal structure will include water molecules.

Ionic solids that include water are called hydrates. They must be named with the number of water molecules (as Greek prefixes) attached at the end of the normal name.

| Prefix | Number of $\ce{H2O}$ molecules |
| ------ | ------------------------------ |
| mono   | 1                              |
| di     | 2                              |
| tri    | 3                              |
| tetra  | 4                              |
| penta  | 5                              |
| hexa   | 6                              |
| hepta  | 7                              |
| octa   | 8                              |
| nona   | 9                              |
| deca   | 10                             |

## Examples

| Compound              | Name                              |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| $\ce{FePO4.8H2O}$     | iron (III) phosphate octahydrate  |
| $\ce{NiCl2.6H2O}$     | nickel (II) chloride hexahydrate  |
| $\ce{Ca(NO3)2.4H2O}$  | calcium nitrate tetrahydrate      |
