# Physical properties

- Can be found without creating a new substance
- Illustrate relationship between energy and state of matter
- E.g., density, colour, hardness, melting point, boiling point
- Can be intensive or extensive:
	- **Extensive:** depends on amount of substance present (mass, volume)
	- **Intensive:** depends only on the nature of the substance, not how much is present (density, melting point, boiling point)
- Intensive properties are used to identify a pure substance from another

## Characteristics 

- Change in size or shape
- Change in phase
- Usually reversible

Energy changes usually do not accompany physical changes, except in phase changes and when substances dissolve.

## Examples

- Water getting warmer when sodium hydroxide dissolves in it
- Pellet of sodium being sliced in two
- Water being heated and subsequently evaporating
- Tire being inflated with air

# Chemical properties

- Substance's tendency to undergo chemical reactions (reactivity) and change into new substances, either by itself or with other substances
- Describes relationship between substance and other forms of matter

## Characteristics

- Light or heat is given off
- Bubbles formed (gas evolved)
- Colour changes
- Formation of precipitation
- Can be difficult to reverse

## Examples

- Potassium chlorate decomposing to potassium chloride and oxygen
- Acid on limestone producing carbon dioxide gas
- Iron rusting
- Milk souring
- Pancakes cooking on a griddle
