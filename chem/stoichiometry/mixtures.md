# Homogenous mixtures

Relatively uniform, appears the same throughout, mixture is same no matter where it's sampled.

**Solutions** are homogenous mixtures where a solute is dissolved in a solvent and the resulting particles are very small ($\pu{10^{-9}m}$).

Concentration of a solution is denoted with $\ce{[]}$ and is a measure of the amount of solute.

| Type of Solution | Example                          |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------- |
| gas-in-gas       | air (oxygen, nitrogen)           |
| gas-in-liquid    | 7-Up ($\ce{CO2}$ in sugar water) |
| liquid-in-liquid | water and alcohol                |
| solid-in-liquid  | salt dissolved in water          |
| solid-in-solid   | alloys (metals melted together)  |

**Colloids** are special homogenous mixtures
* A mixture of 2 phases of matter
* Appear homogenous to the naked eye but are made up of tiny, dispersed particles between $\pu{1nm}$ and $\pu{1\mu m}$, distributed in a solid, liquid, or gas
* Colloid particles can be in a different phase than what they are suspended in
* Remain suspended indefinitely (don't settle out).
* Example: fog, mayonnaise

**Tyndall effect:** scattering of light by colloidal particles; fog is water or ice suspended in air.

# Heterogenous mixtures

Composition varies from position to position within the sample and one or more components is visible to the naked eye.

E.g., sugar and sand in a jar. Because the sand is heavier, there's probably more sand at the bottom of the jar and more sugar at the top.

### Suspensions

- Special type of heterogenous mixture
- Particles are larger than in solutions or colloids and dispersed
- Because of their greater size they will settle out (sediment) if land standing
- Usually, solids in liquids or gases (silt in water or dust in air)

# Physical separation of mixtures

## Mechanical separation techniques

**Density separation:** particles with higher density than the medium will sink (sediment)
- **Decanting:** pouring off liquid leaving sediment
- **Filtration:** separates solid from liquid; pouring through a filter (filter is the filtrate, sediment is the residue.)

**Magnetic separation:** iron filings are magnetic, can separate them out of mixtures of other metals.

**Centrifugation:** rapid spinning increases sinking of particles.
- Used for separating components of blood (red blood cells and platelets sink to bottom, plasma on top; all drugs and metabolites end up in plasma)

## Non-mechanical separation techniques

**Chromatography:** a family of techniques used to separate complex mixtures.

There is a stationary phase (does not move) and a mobile phase (does move) which separates components based on their:
- Relative boiling point (gas chromatography)
- Relative polarity (high performance liquid chromatography
- Solubility in a solvent (paper chromatography)

**Paper chromatography:** method of analysing complex mixtures (ink) by separating them into their primary colour components.

- Drugs in urine or blood samples can be analysed using this method
- Relies on an Rf value (ratio of fronts) as follows:

**Evaporation:** separates solid from liquid. Liquid is boiled away and solid is left over.

**Distillation:** separates liquids from liquids based on their different boiling points. Components are  removed from the homogenous mixture one by one, the liquid with the lowest boiling point collected first.
