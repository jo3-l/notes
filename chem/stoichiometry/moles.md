# Laws of Matter

> [!info] Not on test

**Law of conservation of mass (Lavoisier, 1789):** matter can't be created or destroyed in chemical reaction

- Allows us to balance equations based on mass balance of atoms:
  $$\ce{CH4 + O2 -> CO2 + 2H2O}$$

**Law of definitive proportions (Proust, 1798):** a chemical compound always contains same proportions of elements by mass

- E.g., 1.00 g of $\ce{CO2}$ contains 0.273 g $\ce{O}$ and 0.727 g $\ce{C}$; $16.0 g of $\ce{CO2}$ contains 4.36 g $\ce{O}$ and 11.6 g $\ce{C}$

**Law of multiple proportions (Dalton, 1808):** if two elements form a compound, ratios of masses of two elements will be small whole numbers

- $\ce{CO}$ and $\ce{CO2}$ exist, but $\ce{CO_{1.5}}$ does not

# Relative Atomic Mass

- Mass of one atom/compound of an element relative to carbon
	- Atomic mass of atom can be found on periodic table
	- For compound, take atomic masses of constituent elements multiplied by coefficients and add them up
- Unit is atomic mass units (amu)
- Denoted by $A_r$

> [!note] Definition of amu
> 1 amu = $\frac{1}{12}$ of the mass of $\ce{^12_6 C}$.

# Avogadro's Hypothesis

Equal volumes of different gases at the same temperature and pressure contain the same number of particles.

![[avogadro-hypothesis.png | 450]]

A consequence of Avogadro's hypothesis is that 2L of $\ce{H2}$, $\ce{He}$, $\ce{Ne}$, $\ce{N2}$ **all contain the same number of particles!**

# Moles

- SI unit for amount of substance
- $\pu{1 mol}$ things = $6.02 \times 10^{23}$ things
- A "thing" can be an atom, molecule, ion, formula unit, etc.
- Must always specify type of particle involved in a calculation

> [!important]
> Number of moles is proportional to coefficients in balanced chemical formula.

> [!warning]
> $6.02 \times 10^{23}$ is a rounded value for $\pu{1 mol}$; that is, $6.02 \times 10^{23}$ has limited precision.

# Molar Mass

- Also called relative formula mass or molecular mass
- Denoted by $M_r$
- Numerically identical to relative atomic mass (amu); only difference is unit

> [!note] Definition of molar mass
> The molar mass of a substance is the mass in grams of $\pu{1 mol}$ of the particles that make up the substance.

> [!warning] Unit of molar mass
> Molar mass has units of $\pu{g mol^-1}$.

# Molecules vs Formula Units (FU)

Molecules are generally used to describe covalently-bonded substances while formula units are used to describe one neutral formula unit of an ionic compound.

For example, $\ce{NaCl}$ is one FU of sodium chloride, while $\ce{CaF2}$ is one FU of calcium fluoride.
