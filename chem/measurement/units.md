# SI System

- Stands for "SystÃ©me internationale d'unites"
- Non-static system derived from 7 base units

## SI symbols

- Almost always lower-case letters unless named for a person (except L for litres)
- Full names are usually written in lower case letters (except for degrees Celsius)
- Unit symbols are never pluralized
- Symbols should only be followed by a period at the end of a sentence, e.g., "the penny had a mass of 2.25 g"
- **There is a space between the numerical value and the unit symbol (5.2 g, not 5.2g)**

## SI base units

| Unit name | Unit symbol | Operational definition |
| --------- | ----------- | ---------------------- |
| metre     | $\pu{m}$    | length                 |
| kilogram  | $\pu{kg}$   | mass                   |
| second    | $\pu{s}$    | time                   |
| ampere    | $\pu{A}$    | electric current       |
| kelvin    | $\pu{K}$    | temperature            |
| candela   | $\pu{cd}$   | luminous intensity     |
| mole      | $\pu{mol}$  | amount of substance    |

## Unit prefixes

| Prefix | Symbol                            | Multiplier              |
| ------ | --------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Mega   | M                                 | $10^{6} = 1000000$      |
| Kilo   | k                                 | $10^{3} = 1000$         |
| Base   | Depends on what you are measuring | $10^{0} = 1$            |
| Deci   | d                                 | $10^{-1} = 0.1$         |
| Centi  | c                                 | $10^{-2} = 0.01$        |
| Milli  | m                                 | $10^{-3} = 0.001$       |
| Micro  | $\mu$                             | $10^{-6} = 0.000001$    |
| Nano   | n                                 | $10^{-9} = 0.000000001$ | 

## Derived quantities

- Number made by combining two or more other values
- Derived unit is a unit made by combining two or more other units

### Examples

- Rate (meter and seconds) -> $\pu{m/s}$
- Density (grams and millilitres) -> $\pu{g/mL} = \pu{g/cm^3}$

# Conversions

## Temperature

- Kelvin (K) is SI unit for temperature, but seldom used in real life
- Celsius is the most common scale in most countries
- Fahrenheit is the imperial unit used in the US

## Converting between SI units

Most simple unit conversions can be done using mental math BUT **in Chem 11 you will need to use the method of unitary rates:**

A conversion factor is a multiplier (100 cm = 1 m)
- To convert a number in cm to one in m you will need to multiply by $\dfrac{\pu{1m}}{\pu{100cm}}$
- Keep track and write the units as you do the calculations
- When multiplying units, if the same unit is on the top and bottom they can be crossed out or cancelled

## Unit conversions with exponents

If you are trying to convert a unit that is not squared to one that is squared ($x^2$) or cubed ($x^3$), use the basic conversion factors and square or cube as needed.
