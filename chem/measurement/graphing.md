# Benefits of Graphing

Can easily see if a relationship exists between two variables, and/or what the relationship looks like.

## Types of Variables

- **Controlled variables:** variables that are kept constant in an experiment
- **Independent variable:** variable changed in a controlled way during the experiments. Usually plotted on the horizontal (x) axis.
- **Dependent variable:** the variable you measure. Usually plotted on the vertical (y) axis.

# Sketch vs. Drawn Graphs

## Sketch

**Sketch graphs** are used to shown qualitative trends (direct or inverse proportionality) and the axes are labelled but unscaled.

## Drawn

**Drawn graphs** are used to make quantitative measurements from data, and should include:

1. **Title:** must state the actual variables being compared, usually in the form "variable Y (dependent) vs variable X (independent)".
	- Title should be at top of the graph or in the top part of the graph line portion.
	- Eg., "Volume (of gas produced) vs. Time (of experiment)"
2. **Axes and labels:** Horizontal is for independent variable and vertical is for independent variable. All measured variables have units, so axis labels must as well.
3. **Zero point:** should be plotted iff two variables represent a valid piece of data when they both have a value of zero.
   
   If there is not a real zero point, or you do not know if one is possible, you should not include one on your graph.
   
    **Good example:** when there is 0.0g of mass, there is 0.0mL of volume.
    **Bad example:** volume of a gas between 40 and 50 degrees. Volume of the gas will not be 0.0mL at 0 degrees.
4. **Axis scale uniformity and full use of graph**
	- Each axis scale should be linear and regular divisions of the scale values.
	- Use scientific notation for very small or very large numbers. No fractions.
	- Do not make a scale out of only your actual data points. For each variable, look at upper and lower values of each set of data and make a scale to fit the data.
	- Plot data points over the full range of the graph paper given.

# Interpreting data

- Data points that do not fall within the trend of the others may represent errors.
- Never connect dots; points represent experimental data that have uncertainties associated with them.
- "Best fit" line or curve is the best representation of the relationship between the variables. Should be closest to most data points.
- Interpretation must be shown on the graph, where necessary.

## Determining relationship of variables

Decide if the plotted data looks more like:
1. **Straight line:** can be extended or extrapolated; indicative of a linear relationship.
2. **Curve or regularly changing pattern:** cannot be extended or extrapolated.
3. **No relationship**.
