# Systematic errors

Systematic errors are typically the fault of both the observer and the instrument. Can usually be eliminated by taking greater care to the experimental design.

A key characteristic of systematic errors is that they will **bias measurements in the same direction; all too large or too small.** E.g., ammeter that displays $\pu{0.1A}$ even if there is no current will lead all measurements being greater by $\pu{0.1A}$.

Can be further subdivided into three types:
- **Instrumentation errors** (e.g., using a faulty gas syringe);
- **Experimental methodology errors** (e.g., evaporation of volatile liquids upon heating a sample);
- **Personal errors** (e.g., misidentifying the color of a solution due to colorblindness.)

Systematic errors affect the **accuracy** of a result.

# Random errors

Random errors occur because of uncontrolled variables and are therefore unpreventable. However, the impact of such errors may be reduced by taking multiple measurements and averaging the result.

Random errors are unbiased and are revealed when repeated measurements of the same quantity result in different values. E.g. if multiple people use stopwatch to time a race, all start at slightly different times.

Random errors affect the **precision** of a result.

## Reading uncertainties

Reading uncertainties are a special type of random uncertainty (e.g. using a ruler to measure an object that lies between two markings on a the ruler.)

### Analogue devices

The uncertainty in reading an **analogue device** like a ruler is half its smallest width. For example, a ruler with $\pu{0.2cm}$ markings would have an uncertainty of $\pm \pu{0.1cm}$.

Note that if measuring the width of an object using a ruler, one must account for uncertainty on both ends of the ruler, so the final uncertainty may need to be multiplied by two.

### Digital devices

The uncertainty in reading a **digital device** like a stopwatch is $\pm 1$ in the least significant digit. E.g. if a stopwatch reads $\pu{15.52s}$ the least significant digit is the $2$ and so the uncertainty is $\pu{0.01s}$.

Again, note that if we are measuring the time elapsed since a certain point, uncertainty at the start and end points must both be accounted for. Thus, if one uses a stopwatch to time a race and obtains a measurement of $\pu{17.85s}$, the measurement with uncertainty should be $\pu{(17.85 \pm 0.02)s}$.
