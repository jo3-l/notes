# Interpreting data

- Data points that do not fall within the trend of the others may represent errors.
- Never connect dots; points represent experimental data that have uncertainties associated with them.
- "Best fit" line or curve is the best representation of the relationship between the variables. Should be closest to most data points.
- Interpretation must be shown on the graph, where necessary.

# Interpolation and extrapolation

- **Interpolation** Estimating an unknown point between two known points.
- **Extrapolation:** Estimating an unknown point outside the range of points by extending the line/curve.

# Determining relationship of variables

> [!note]
> It is possible for there to be no relation between variables at all. This occurs when points are scattered all over the graph without any clear pattern.

### Straight lines

If the points form a straight line or are close to a straight line, then the relationship is probably linear. Linear relationships can be extended and extrapolated.

The relevant mathematical relationship may be determined by taking the slope between the **first and last point.**

## Curves

> [!warning] Common Mistake
> Curves cannot be extended or extrapolated, so DO NOT extend past the points plotted.

If the points appear to form a curve, first consider what the expected relationship is based on the context of the lab/experiment.

For example, if one is investigating the relationship between a circle's diameter and its area, we would expect that the area to be directly proportional to the square of the diameter. That is:

$$
A \propto D^2
$$

Thus we can choose to "straighten out" the line by instead plotting $A$ vs $D^2$. Compare:

![[graphing-20220928.17.09.14.excalidraw | 350]]

We can easily determine the mathematical relationship for the straightened line by taking the slope between the first and last point, similar to a linear relationship.
