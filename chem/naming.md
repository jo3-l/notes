# Ionic Compounds

> [!info]
> An ionic compound is typically composed of a metal and a non-metal.

## Formula From Name

1. Write the name of the cation (typically a metal.)
   E.g., in  $\ce{NaCl}$, we would write "sodium" first.

   If the ion is multivalent, then use Roman numerals between the cation and anion to represent the charge. E.g., in $\ce{MnO2}$, name of the metal is manganese (IV.)

2. Write the name of the anion (typically a non-metal) with the suffix -ide added to the end.
   E.g., in $\ce{NaCl}$, chlorine becomes chloride.
> [!warning]
> Do not change the names of polyatomic ions. E.g., $\ce{(NH4)2SO4}$ should be ammonium sulfate.

### Examples

| Compound         | Name                 |
| ---------------- | -------------------- |
| $\ce{CoCl2}$     | cobalt (II) chloride |
| $\ce{Pb(CO3)2}$  | lead (IV) carbonate  |
| $\ce{(NH4)2SO4}$ | ammonium sulfate     |

## Name From Formula

1. Write both ions with their charges.
2. Balance the charges to get a neutral compound.

E.g., given magnesium chloride, we know that the two ions are $\ce{Mg^2+}$ and $\ce{Cl^-}$. Balancing gives us $\ce{MgCl2}$.

> [!note] Multivalent Ions
> To determine the charge of a multivalent ion in an ionic compound, look at the Roman numeral after it.
>
> E.g., if in gold (III) bromide, the charge of the gold ion is $+3$ and hence we have $\ce{AuBr3}$.

# Hydrate

Ionic solids that include water are called hydrates. Must be named with the number of water molecules (as [[naming#Appendix: Greek Prefixes | Greek Prefixes]]) attached at the end of the normal name.

## Examples

| Compound              | Name                              |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| $\ce{FePO4.8H2O}$     | iron (III) phosphate octahydrate  |
| $\ce{NiCl2.6H2O}$     | nickel (II) chloride hexahydrate  |
| $\ce{Ca(NO3)2.4H2O}$  | calcium nitrate tetrahydrate      |

# Covalent Compounds

- Elements on the left side of the periodic table are named first
- If two elements are in same family, lower one is named first
- Use [[naming#Appendix: Greek Prefixes | Greek Prefixes]] for number of atoms
- Add -ide ending to second element

> [!warning]
> If the coefficient for first element is 1, do not add "mono": $\ce{CO}$ is carbon monoxide, not monocarbon monoxide.

## Examples

| Compound     | Name                       |
| ------------ | -------------------------- |
| $\ce{P4S3}$  | tetraphosphorus trisulfide |
| $\ce{Si3N4}$ | trisilicon tetranitride    |
| $\ce{BrF}$   | bromine monofluoride       |

# Acids

Have general formula $\ce{HX_{(aq)}}$ where

- $\ce{H}$ is hydrogen ion
- $\ce{X}$ is non-metal ion or negatively charged polyatomic ion
- $\ce{(aq)}$ means aqueous, meaning diluted in $\ce{H2O}$

> [!warning]
> Do not forget the $\ce{(aq)}$! E.g., $\ce{HF_{(aq)}}$ is hydrofluoric acid, but $\ce{HF}$ is just hydrogen fluoride.

## Binary Acids

Consist of hydrogen and one other element. Name is "hydro___ic acid".

### Examples

| Compound          | Name               |
| ----------------- | ------------------ |
| $\ce{HCL_{(aq)}}$ | hydrochloric acid  |
| $\ce{H2S_{(aq)}}$ | hydrosulfuric acid |
| $\ce{HI_{(aq)}}$  | hydroiodic acid    |

## Ternary Acids

Consist of hydrogen and a polyatomic ion. Name depends on ion used:

- **"-ate" ions become "-ic"**, e.g., $\ce{SO4^2-}$ is sulfate so $\ce{H2SO4_{(aq)}}$ is sulfuric acid
- **"-ite" ions become "-ous"**, e.g., $\ce{SO3^2-}$ is sulfite so $\ce{H2SO3_{(aq)}}$ is sulfurous acid

### Examples

| Compound            | Name              |
| ------------------- | ----------------- |
| $\ce{HClO4_{(aq)}}$ | perchloric acid   |
| $\ce{HClO3_{(aq)}}$ | chloric acid      |
| $\ce{HClO2_{(aq)}}$ | chlorous acid     |
| $\ce{HClO_{(aq)}}$  | hypochlorous acid |
| $\ce{H3PO4_{(aq)}}$ | phosphoric acid   |
