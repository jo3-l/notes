# Position-time

- Slope of line is velocity
	- Positive slope = positive velocity = motion in the positive direction
	- Conventionally, right/up/east/north are positive, left/down/west/south are negative
- Flat line: velocity of 0
- Straight line: constant velocity
- Parabola: velocity is changing

Instantaneous velocity at $t_1$ is the slope of the tangent line.

# Velocity-time

- Slope of line is acceleration
- Straight line: constant acceleration
- Area under graph is displacement
