- **Distance**: length of path travelled
- **Length**: same as distance
- **Position**: absolute location relative to fixed point
- **Displacement**: final position - start position
- **Velocity**: displacement/time (not distance/time), rate of change in position
- **Speed**: distance/time
- **Average velocity**: total displacement/total time
- **Instantaneous velocity**: same as velocity
- **Vector**: quantity with a magnitude and direction
- **Scalar**: quantity with a magnitude only

> [!warning] Common Mistake
> IB defines displacement as position with the reference frame as the initial position.
