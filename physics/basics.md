# What is Physics?

Study of...
- How things move and interact
- Energy (forces) and matter (particles)

Physics is an experimental discipline, though there are purely theoretical aspects.

# SI Units

| Quantity                  | Base Unit     | Derived Units                        |
| ------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Length/distance (l, d, x) | Metre (m)     | Centimeter (cm), nanometer (nm), ... |
| Displacement (s)          | Metre (m)     | Centimer (cm), nanometer (nm), ...   |
| Mass (m)                  | Kilogram (kg) | Gram (g)                             |
| Time (t)                  | Seconds (s)   | Minute, hour                         |

1. Title, name (first and last initial);
2. Introduction
	- Hypothesis
	- Background theory
3. Materials
4. Procedure (paraphrase; don't copy)
5. Observations (table with units and uncertainties)
6. Analysis (graphs, sample calculations)
7. Conclusion
	- Does the data support the hypothesis? How close (percent deviation?)
	- Sources of uncertainty -- quantify and mention factors not included in hypothesis
