# General Tips

- Always relate response to question; don't go off-topic
- Allocate time wisely
- Think before writing (underline/highlight/ relevant phrases and so on)
- Other than question 4, do _not_ refer to your own knowledge

# Question 1

## Part a)

Worth 3 marks; should not spend more than **5 minutes**.

- Summarize message of the source based on prompt
- Three main points; three sentences
- Do not repeat points that have already been made
- Phrases to use
	- "The first point the source is making is... The second is... The third is..."

> [!warning]
> Don't go overboard on analysis/look too deeply: just paraphrase parts of the text and include **short** quotations.

## Part b)

Worth 2 marks; should not spend more than **5 minutes**.

- Summarize message of cartoon/image based on prompt
- Two main points; two sentences

# Question 2

Worth 6 marks; should not spend more than **15 minutes**.

- Evaluate origin, purpose, value and limitations (OPVL)
- Origin
	- Who wrote it/said it/drew it?
	- When did the person write it/say it/draw it?
	- Where did the person write it/say it/draw it?
	- What is the source -- a speech/cartoon/textbook, etc.?
- Purpose
	- Why did the person write it/say it/draw it?
	- Who did the person write it/say it/draw it for?
- Value/purpose
	- Is the language objective or does it sound exaggerated or one-sided?
	- What is the tone of the source?
	- What information and examples do they select or focus on to support their point?

## Values and Limitations of Various Text Types

> [!warning]
> Use this table as a guide, but be careful not overgeneralize according to the text type. E.g., given an interview as a source, do not simply state that it may reflect an insight into opinions at the time -- be specific and draw examples from the text.

# Question 3

Worth 6 marks; should not spend more than **15 minutes**.

- Compare and contrast content of source based on prompt
- Use direct quotations (underline ones that you will be using)
- Two paragraphs: one with three similarities, other with three differences

> [!tip] Phrases to use when showing similarities
> - Both Source A and Source B ...
> - Source A suggests ...; similarly, Source B suggests ...
> - Source A supports Source B ...
> - Like Source B, Source A says ...
> - In the same way that Source B argues ..., Source A points out that

> [!tip] Phrases to use when showing differences
> - Source A suggests ...; however, Source B says ...
> - Source B disagrees with Source A regarding ...
> - Source A claims ... as opposed to Source B which asserts ...
> - Source B goes further than Source A in arguing ... while A focuses on ...

> [!warning]
> **Do not** address the sources separately; you should have a running commentary of the points both make in relation to each other.
>
> **Do not** discuss why the sources might differ.
>
> **Do not** simply identify what is mentioned in one source but not another.

# Question 4

Worth 9 marks.

- Write min-essay responding to question
- Reference _all_ sources, but also add own knowledge
- Show balance in arguments, especially if sources offer varied opinions
