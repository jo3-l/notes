# Founding Fathers

- Claimed to be opposed to slavery on a moral basis, but all of the earliest presidents (excluding John Adams) owned slaves
	- E.g. Thomas Jefferson -- despite calling slavery a "moral depravity", a "hideous blot", and an "assemblage of horrors" -- was a slaveowner throughout his life and profited immensely from it
- Founding documents of the US didn't mention slavery, leaving the matter for future generations to resolve

# Buildup to the Civil War

- **1815-1861**: economy of Northern states diversified away from agriculture due to industrialization
- In contrast, Southern economy was based primarily on plantations which produced cotton (and thus was reliant on slaves for labor)
	- As price of cotton skyrocketed, diversifying seemed unwise
	- Per-capita wealth of Southern whites was 2x that of Northerners in 1860
- More and more Northerners began supporting abolishing slavery for moral reasons, making Southerners anxious
- **1860**: [[lincoln | Abraham Lincoln]], candidate of the antislavery Republican Party, wins the presidential election
- **February 4, 1861:** South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas secede and form the Confederate States of America
- **April 2, 1861**: Confederate Troops open fire on Fort Sumter, marking the beginning of the Civil War
- At the start of the Civil War, more than 4 million people, nearly all of African descent, were enslaved

# Emancipation Proclamation

> [!quote]
> [A]ll persons held as slaves within any States, or designated part of the State, the people whereof shall be in rebellion against the United States, shall be then, thenceforward, and forever free.

- Up to 1862, Lincoln, despite being a lifelong opponent of slavery, was conflicted as to how precisely to deal with the matter
- However, in 1862, he became convinced that emancipating (i.e., setting free) slaves in Southern states would be a sound strategic move and would help the North win the war
- As the proclamation applied to states outside Lincoln's control at the time, it had very little effect on actually freeing slaves and was therefore mostly symbolic

# Path to Ratification

- **April 1864**: U.S. Senate passes proposed amendment banning slavery
- However, House of Representatives falters (especially Democrats, given that it was an election year)
- Lincoln secures reelection in the fall and is free to devote his energies toward garnering support
- **January 31, 1865**: House of Representatives passes the 13th Amendment with a vote of 119-56; sent to state legislatures for final ratification
- **December 6, 1865:** Necessary number of states (three-fourths) ratify the amendment
