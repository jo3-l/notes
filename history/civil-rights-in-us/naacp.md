> The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) was established in 1909 and is America's oldest and largest civil rights organization. It played a key part in the early Black rights movement and remained influential -- though less so -- throughout the Civil Rights era of the 50s and 60s. 

# NAACP

- NAACP: National Association for Advancement of Colored People; oldest and largest American civil rights organization
- Founded on February 12, 1909 in NYC by a group of activists following the 1908 Springfield race riot in Illinois, in which a white mob looted businesses, burned homes, and murdered two African Americans
- Founding members were a mix of progressive whites and African American civil rights activists, including WEB Du Bois, Mary White Ovington, Joel and Arthur Spingarn, Mary McLeod Bethune among others
- Purpose was to "secure for all people the rights guaranteed in the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments to the United States Constitution, which promised an end to slavery, the equal protection of the law, and universal adult male suffrage"
- Part of its work was its publication, *The Crisis*, edited by NAACP founder WEB Du Bois

# Early history

- *Guinn v. United States*: In 1910, Oklahoma passed a constitutional amendment permitting certain illiterate whites to vote while discriminating against blacks through a grandfather clause
	- NAACP challenged the law in court; case went all the way to the Supreme Court which ruled in 1915 that grandfather clauses were unconstitutional
- Another key objective for the NAACP in its early years was anti-lynching and the reduction of violence against Black people in general
	- In 1917, the NAACP organized a silent march to protest lynching in NYC; around 10,000 people attended, making it one of the first mass demonstrations against racial violence in America
- Membership rose from 9k to 1909 to 90k in 1919 to nearly half a million by the end of  WWII

# Civil Rights era

- NAACP was key to the civil rights movement of the 50s and 60s and played a part in shaping and securing numerous legislative victories, such as
	- [[brown-v-board-of-ed | Brown vs Board of Education]] (outlawing segregation in public schools)
	- Civil Rights Act of 1964 (prohibiting race-based discrimination)
	- Voting Rights Act of 1965 (outlawing racial discrimination in voting)
- Organized March on Washington (see also [[martin-luther-king | Martin Luther King]]), one of the largest civil rights protests in history
- However, as time passed, the NAACP was increasingly being viewed as a symbol of the cautious establishment and was criticized for not taking enough risks to advance Black rights
