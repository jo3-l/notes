# NAACP

- NAACP: stands for National Association for Advancement of Colored People; oldest and largest American civil rights organization
- Established in Feb. 1909 in NYC by a group of activists following the 1908 Springfield race riot in Illinois
	- The Springfield race riot occurred after two Black men held in a Springfield jail were transferred to another city; consequently, a white mob burned down homes, raided businesses, and murdered two African Americans
- Founding members were a mix of progressive whites and African American civil rights activists
- Some early members came from the Niagara Movement, another civil rights group started earlier in 1905 by W.E.B. Du Bois

# Early victories

- *Guinn v. United States*: In 1910, Oklahoma passed a constitutional amendment permitting certain illiterate whites to vote while discriminating against blacks through a grandfather clause
	- NAACP challenged the law in court; case went all the way to the Supreme Court which ruled in 1915 that grandfather clauses were unconstitutional
- Another key objective for the NAACP in its early years was anti-lynching and more generally reducing violence against Black people
	- In 1917, the NAACP organized a silent march to protest lynching in NYC; around 10,000 people attended, making it one of the first mass demonstrations against racial violence in America
- By 1919, the NAACP had ~90k members and more than 300 branches

# Civil Rights era

- NAACP was key to the civil rights movement of the 50s and 60s and played a part in numerous legislative victories, such as
	- [[brown-v-board-of-ed | Brown vs Board of Education]] (outlawing segregation in public schools)
	- Civil Rights Act of 1964 (prohibiting race-based discrimination)
	- Voting Rights Act of 1965 (outlawing racial discrimination in voting)
- Organized March on Washington (see also [[mlk | Martin Luther King]]), one of the largest civil rights protests in history

# Present

- NAACP is still around and now focused on promoting equity in education, employment, and criminal justice in addition to protecting voting rights
- In 2021, had over 2,2000 branches and over half a million members worldwide
