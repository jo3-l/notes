> Rosa Parks, aka the "mother of the civil rights movement", indirectly sparked the Civil Rights movement of the 50s and 60s (hence the name) after being arrested for refusing to give up her seat on a racially segregated bus in Montgomery, Alabama on Dec 1, 1955.

# Early Life

- Born in Tuskegee, Alabama on February 4, 1913
- Mother was a teacher and thus did her best to provide Rosa with a good education
- Rosa attended high school at Alabama State Teachers' College for Negroes, but dropped out in 11th grade to care for ailing grandmother and later mother
- Married long-time NAACP member Raymond Parks in 1932
- With his encouragement, Rosa finished her last year of high school the following year and earned her diploma

# Roots of Activism

- Raymond and Rosa became respected members of the local Black civil rights community
- Despite Raymond's concerns for Rosa's safety, she ended up joining the NAACP as well and became chapter secretary, working closely with president Edgar Daniel "E.D." Nixon

# Arrest

- On Dec 1, 1955, Parks boarded a bus on her way back home from work and sat down in the section for Blacks at the front
	- At the time, seats on the bus were segregated by race
- Some time later, a white man boarded and, upon seeing that there was no spot available in the section for Whites, the driver ordered riders in the first row of the Black section to vacate their spots
	- Whether his request had to be obeyed by law is debatable; Montgomery laws surrounding the matter were self-contradictory
- While the other three passengers in the row obeyed the driver's command, Parks refused to give up her spot
- When two police officers came to investigate, they arrested Parks

# Aftermath

- Parks was released on bail and met her husband and E.D. Nixon at her home upon release
- E.D. Nixon had been secretly hoping for such an opportunity to arise in order to act as a catalyst for a broader civil rights movement, and convinced Parks to act as the face of said movement
	- To this end, he planned a boycott the day of Park's trial and arranged for 35,000 flyers to be sent to Black schoolchildren to spread the news
- On December 5, Parks was found guilty of violating segregation charges and fined
- Turnout in the ensuing boycott was massive; taking advantage of the momentum, Nixon formed the Montgomery Improvement Association (MIA) and appointed [[martin-luther-king | Martin Luther King]] as president
- Lawsuits calling for the end of segregation laws went all the way to the Supreme Court
- Local white population was highly disgruntled; Nixon and MLK's homes were bombed
- However, that did not stop the Supreme Court from ruling bus segregation unconstitutional on November 13, 1956 in _Browder v. Gayle_, marking the end of the protests

# Later Life

- Parks moved to Detroit in the wake of the ruling due to sustained harassment and threats
- Became an aide to Congressman John Conyers Jr. in 1965
- Co-founded Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self-Development in 1987
- Awarded Congressional Gold Medal in 1999, the highest honor conferred upon civilians
- Died at the age of 92 on October 24, 2005
