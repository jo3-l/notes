> The Freedom Summer project was a voting drive intended to encourage African-Americans in Mississippi to register.

# Context

- Civil rights movement was in full swing by 1964
	- [[freedom-riders | Freedom Riders]] spent 1961 riding interstate buses in protest of the non-enforcement of _Boynton v. Virginia_
	- [[martin-luther-king | MLK]] delivered his famous speech "I Have a Dream" during the March on Washington in 1963
- Despite progress, South remained largely segregated, especially at polls
- African Americans faced violence and intimidation when they attempted to register to vote
- Freedom Summer project -- a voter registration drive -- aimed to change that
- Organized by Congress on Racial Equality (CORE) + Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), and ran by local Council of Federated Organizations (COFO)
- Mississippi was chosen as the location of project due to its historically low levels of African American voter registration
	- Less than 7% of eligible Black voters registered in 1962

# Timeline

- **June 15, 1964:** First batch of volunteers arrive in Mississippi
	- Project director Robert "Bob" Moses made them pledge to "nonviolence in all situations"
- Soon after, three volunteers (Schwerner and Goodman, white students from NYC; and Chaney, a local Black man) went missing after visiting Philadelphia
- Their beaten bodies were found six weeks later, lynched by a KKK mob protected by a local policeman
- Despite this chilling incident, Freedom Summer volunteers persisted in their mission

# Impact

- Voter registration was not greatly impacted; 17,000 Black Mississippians attempted to register to vote, but only 1,200 succeeded
- However, did lead to increased public awareness in discrimination against African Americans wrt voting rights
- Was a possible factor in convincing Congress to pass the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965
- Caused division in civil rights leaders: those who still favored nonviolence vs those who thought more militant measures would be beneficial
