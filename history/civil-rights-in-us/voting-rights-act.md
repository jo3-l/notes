# Buildup

- [[johnson | Lyndon B. Johnson]] became president after assassination of JFK
- Elected in a landslide in 1964 and promised to push for legislation aimed toward improving Americans' lives such as voting-rights laws
- 15th Amendment technically prohibited states from denying citizens the right to vote based on race/color
- However, discriminatory laws and practices meant that many Black citizens were still unable to vote
	- E.g. election officials told Black people they had gotten date, time, polling place wrong
	- Black people were forced to take literacy tests, which they sometimes failed due to high rate of illiteracy
	- Some officials in Southern states forced Black voters to perform nigh-impossible tasks such as reciting the Constitution in its entirety
