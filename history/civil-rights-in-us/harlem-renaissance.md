> The Harlem Renaissance was a period of intellectual and cultural breakthrough in the Black community centered in the Harlem neighbor of NYC spanning from the 1910s to the mid-1930s.

# The Great Migration

- Movement of rural southern African Americans to northern cities
- Began in the 1910s and continued for much of the 20th century
- Approximately 1 million Black people left South by end of 1919

## Causes

- Though [[13th-amendment | 13th Amendment]] outlawed slavery, racial inequality persisted in the South due to so-called "Jim Crow" laws, which dictated what African Americans could and could not do
	- Also, while Ku Klux Klan was officially dissolved in 1869, underground branches continued running (and so intimidation, violence, and lynching of Blacks continued)
- WWI led to a shortage of industrial laborers in the North, Midwest and West, as the war halted the tide of European immigration
- Recruiters put out ads to entice Blacks to move north, and Black newspapers like the *Chicago Defender* shared first-person success accounts
- Around 1916, a Black factory worker in the North could expect to make approximately 3x more than a farm worker in the South

# Harlem

- Harlem was a Manhattan neighborhood intended for upper-class whites only; however, demand was overestimated and many buildings remained empty
- Landlords eventually caved in and permitted Black families to move in
- Initially white residents fought to keep Blacks out, but were unsuccessful and left the area
- As more and more Blacks migrated to the North as a result of the Great Migration, Harlem became a cultural center
- Nearly 175,000 African Americans settled in Harlem (meaning it had one of the highest concentrations of black people in the world), including some of the brightest minds of the era

# Harlem Renaissance

- Name given to the period between end of WW1 and the 1930s in which Black community centered in Harlem redefined African American culture through producing significant works of literature, music, stage performance and art
- Unique feature of the Harlem Renaissance was its close relation to civil rights movements and reform organizations
	- Magazines like _The Crisis_ (published by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People); _Opportunity_ (published by the National Urban League) and _The Messenger_ were key parts of the movement
- Cut short by the Stock Market Crash of 1929 and the subsequent Great Depression, wherein financial support for the arts and Black businesses dwindled

# Legacy

- Inspired future generations of African American creators and intellectuals
- Challenged longstanding stereotypes of African Americans
	- Established authority of African Americans to define their own representation in arts and media
- Provided a foundation for future Black civil rights movements
- Certain African American writers denounced the Harlem Renaissance for its ties to White sponsors
	- In particular, Marcus Garvey, founder of the Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA) castigated thought leaders of the Harlem Renaissance for being "weak-kneed and cringing ... [flatterers of] the white man"
