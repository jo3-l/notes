> Freedom Riders were civil rights activists who participated in bus trips in 1961 to draw attention to interstate bus segregation, which ran contrary to the Supreme Court's rulings in *Morgan v. Virginia* and *Boynton v. Virginia*. Despite violent attacks by white mobs, the practice grew in popularity and ultimately pushed the Interstate Commerce Commission to issue regulations prohibiting segregation in interstate transit terminals later that year.
