> Sit-ins were a form of nonviolent protest developed in 1960 by local Black students in Greensboro, North Carolina. Participants would go to segregated lunch counters and refuse to leave when denied service, drawing attention to their cause and creating economic hardships for businesses. Though it did not lead to any major legislative changes, sit-ins caused many local businesses to desegregate and informed future forms of protest.

# Origins

- First lunch-counter sit-in took place in Greensboro, North Carolina on February 1, 1960
- Four freshmen from a local Black college sat down at the "whites only" lunch counter at the local F.W. Woolworth dept. store
- Placed an order but were refused service due to their race
- Eventually asked to leave but stayed until closing instead, returning the next day with a larger group
- Quickly spread across the country; by the end of February, similar sit-ins had been organized in nine other states
- Ultimately, approximately 70,000 individuals (Blacks and whites alike) would end up participating in sit-ins

# Effects

- Disrupted and drew unwanted publicity to affected businesses, making voluntary desegregation a more attractive option
- Sit-in participants took up spaces for paying customers, leading to economic hardship for business owners
- Nonviolent and courteous behavior of sit-in participants garnered sympathy from the public and portrayed African Americans as responsible members of society
- In contrast, abusive and violent behavior of local mobs in their attempts to break up the sit-ins showed the cruelty of the segregated system

# Significance

- Sit-ins led African Americans to realize that they could change their communities with coordinated action
- Marked the first major effort by local Blacks in civil rights activism
- Informed future forms of protests like [[freedom-riders | Freedom Rides]]
