> _Brown v. Board of Education_ (1954) was a precedent-setting decision in which the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that racial segregation in public schools was unconstitutional.

# History

- In _Plessy v. Ferguson_ (1896), Supreme Court ruled that segregation in public facilities was legal as long as the facilities for both races are equal ("separate but equal doctrine")
- This ruling stood until the 1950s, when the NAACP began filing lawsuits challenging segregation laws in public schools
- In the case that made its way to the Supreme Court, plaintiff Oliver Brown filed a suit against the Board of Education of Topeka after his daughter was denied access to an all-white elementary school
- Argued that
	1. Schools for Black children were not equal to schools for white children, in contravention of separate but equal doctrine;
	2. Segregation violated the 14th Amendment in that no state can "deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws"
- Initially, US District Court in Kansas upheld the original ruling in _Plessy_ despite recognizing the "detrimental effect upon the colored children" and contribution to "a sense of inferiority"

# Supreme Court Verdict

- Thurgood Marshall, head of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, served as chief attorney for the plaintiffs
	- Years later, Marshall would be appointed to the Supreme Court (thereby becoming the first Black justice)
- Initially, Chief Justice Fred M. Vinson held that _Plessy_ should stand; however, he died before the case was to be heard in the Supreme Court
- Pres. Eisenhower appointed Earl Warren as the new Chief Justice, and this was confirmed by the Senate on **March 1, 1954**
- Warren was considerably more progressive-minded, and succeeded in convincing his fellow justices to rule unanimously against segregation
- On **May 17, 1954**, Warren wrote "in the field of public education the doctrine of 'separate but equal' has no place", as segregated schools are "inherently unequal"
- Though the Supreme Court's ruling prohibited segregation in theory, it left implementation to lower courts, leading to some friction in practice (see [[little-rock-nine | Little Rock Nine incident]])
