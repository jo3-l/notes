# Rise to Prominence

- Despite threats and a bombing, King remained true to the cause
- Following success of Montgomery protests, King established the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) to promote full equality of African Americans
	- Lectured all around the country and the globe
- In 1960, King moved back to Atlanta, where he became co-pastor of his father's church, the Ebenezer Baptist Church

# Conflict with Other Activists

## Birmingham Protests: Negotiation vs Protest

 - In the spring of 1963, King campaigned along with local protestors to end segregation at lunch counters and in hiring practices, for which he was jailed
- Some of the white clergy (and even some of the black clergy) looked upon King's practices with disdain, reasoning that negotiation would be far more effective than protest
	- In response, King wrote an eloquent letter from the Birmingham jail in which he was imprisoned, stating:
> [!quote]
> You may well ask: “Why direct action? Why sit-ins, marches and so forth? Isn’t negotiation a better path?” You are quite right in calling for negotiation. Indeed, this is the very purpose of direct action. Nonviolent direct action seeks to create such a crisis and foster such a tension that a community which has constantly refused to negotiate is forced to confront the issue.	

## Nonviolence Policy

- King's longstanding stance on nonviolent protest above all else led to clashes with younger Black civil rights activists, who increasingly labelled him as passive and old
- E.g., during March 1965 demonstrations in Selma, Alabama, King unexpectedly turned back upon facing a barricade of state troopers to avoid bloodshed, raising suspicions that there had been an arrangement with federal and local authorities
- Malcolm X went as far as to say:
> [!quote]
> Concerning nonviolence, it is criminal to teach a man not to defend himself when he is the constant victim of brutal attacks.

# Assassination

- On April 4, 1968, King was assassinated in Memphis, Tennessee by James Earl Ray for dubious reasons
- Caused riots around the country and the globe, leading Pres. Johnson to plead for Americans to "reject the blind violence" that had killed King

# Legacy

- King was and remains one of the most widely known African Americans leaders in history, having dedicated his life to the pursuit of racial equality in America
- Charisma and eloquence was without parallel and doubtless contributed to his influence
