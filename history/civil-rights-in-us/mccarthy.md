> Joseph McCarthy was an American senator who instigated the "Red Scare" in the late 40s and early 50s. In his position as the head of the Committee on Government Operations, he launched baseless investigations into communist infiltration of the US government.

# Early life and career

- Joseph McCarthy was born November 14, 1908 near Appleton, Wisconsin
- Served as circuit judge for three years
- Enlisted in US Marine Corps in WWII
- Won Republican nomination for the Senate in 1946 and was elected that autumn

# Rise to national spotlight

- In Feb 1950, at an appearance at the Ohio County Women's Republican Club in West Virgina, McCarthy claimed he had a list of 205 members of the Communist Party "working and shaping policy" in the State Department
- Senate investigation found no evidence to substantiate McCarthy's claims
- McCarthy was unable to produce any names of interest when questioned
- Tension caused by the swift rise of the Soviet Union in recent years led many of the public to abandon logic and blindly believe in McCarthy's claims
- Some disapproved of his rhetoric, e.g. [[eisenhower | Pres. Eisenhower]], who supported McCarthy in public to preserve party unity but privately loathed him
	- Once stated to an aide "I will not get into the gutter with this guy"
- At the beginning of his second term in 1953, McCarthy was put in charge of the Committee on Government Operations
	- In this role, he launched countless unjustified investigations featuring aggressive interrogations and civil rights abuses
	- Approximately 2,000 government employees lost their jobs despite having done nothing wrong as a result

# Fall from grace

- McCarthy's support dwindled over time as more and more people grew tired of his tactics, but up to 1954 he was mostly tolerated
- However, in April, McCarthy turned his attention to the armed services, claiming that it had been infiltrated by communists
- The investigations (known as the "Army-McCarthy hearings") were broadcast on national TV
- Audience looked on as McCarthy intimidated witnesses while repeatedly failing to produce evidence when questioned
- Final straw came when McCarthy lambasted a young Army lawyer; in response, the chief Army counsel responded, "Have you no sense of decency, sir?"
- This marked the beginning of the end for McCarthy; on December 2, 1954, the Senate formally chastised him for conduct "contrary to Senate traditions"
- Died young at the age of 48 on May 2, 1957, being largely ignored by his colleagues following the Senate censure
