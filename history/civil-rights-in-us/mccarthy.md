# Pre-Senate life

- Joseph McCarthy was born November 14, 1908 near Appleton, Wisconsin
- Served as circuit judge for three years
- Enlisted in US Marine Corps in WWII
- Won Republican nomination for the Senate in 1946 and was elected that autumn

# Rise to national spotlight

- In Feb 1950, in an appearance at the Ohio County Women's Republican Club in West Virgina, McCarthy claimed he had a list of 205 members of the Communist Party "working and shaping policy" in the State Department
- Subsequently, a Senate investigation found no evidence to substantiate McCarthy's claims
- McCarthy was himself unable to produce any names of interest when questioned
- Nonetheless, the tension-filled environment caused by the swift rise of the Soviet Union in recent years led Americans to abandon logic and blindly believe in these unsubstantiated claims, marking the beginning of a witch hunt which would go on for half a decade
- However, there were some that disapproved of his rhetoric, notably [[eisenhower | Pres. Eisenhower]], who supported McCarthy in public to preserve public unity but privately loathed him, once stating to an aide "I will not get into the gutter with this guy"
- In spite of this, McCarthy was put in charge of the Committee on Government Operations, in which he launched countless unjustified investigations featuring aggressive interrogations and civil rights abuses
	- Approximately 2,000 government employees lost their jobs despite having done nothing wrong as a result of these investigations

# Fall from grace

- McCarthy's support dwindled over time as more and more people grew tired of his tactics, but up to 1954 he was mostly tolerated
- However, in April of that year, McCarthy turned his attention to the armed services, claiming that it had been infiltrated by communist forces
- The investigations (which came to be known as the "Army-McCarthy hearings") were broadcast on national television
- The whole of America looked on as McCarthy intimidated witnesses while repeatedly failing to produce evidence himself
- Final straw came when McCarthy lambasted a young Army lawyer; in response, the chief Army counsel responded, "Have you no sense of decency, sir?"
- This marked the beginning of the end for McCarthy; on December 2, 1954, the Senate formally chastised him for conduct "contrary to Senate traditions"
- Died young at the age of 48 on May 2, 1957, being largely ignored by his colleagues following the Senate censure
