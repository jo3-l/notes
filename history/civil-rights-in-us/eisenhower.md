# Presidency

## Domestic Policy

- Eisenhower was a moderate Republican, and achieved multiple policy goals despite Democrats controlling Congress
- Continued New Deal and Fair Deal programs, strengthened Social Security, and increased min. wage
- Refrained from public criticism of [[mccarthy | Senator McCarthy's anti-communist agenda]] (which impacted civil liberties of many Americans), but privately worked to undermine and discredit McCarthy
- When the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that school segregation was unconstitutional in [[brown-v-board-of-ed | Brown v. Board of Education]] in 1954, Eisenhower was hesitant to use his authority to enforce the court's verdict, but did end up deploying federal troops to Arkansas to force integration in the [[little-rock-nine | Little Rock Nine incident]]

## Foreign Policy
