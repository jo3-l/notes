# Roots

- Despite momentum of 60s Civil Rights movement, some African Americans believed that the progress was too slow
- Thought that mere protest was insufficient to manifest change
- Black Power movement emphasized these ideas, arguing that African Americans should focus on creating economic, social, and political power of their own
- Certain factions of the movement, incl. the militant Black Panther Party, supported violence as a means of pursuing their goals
- Inspired by Malcolm X, who famously urged African Americans to protect themselves against white aggression "by any means necessary"
