# Early life

- Born January 15, 1929 in Atlanta, Georgia
- Came from a middle-class family and had comparatively comfortable upbringing to most
- Father and grandfather were both Baptist preachers; parents were college-educated
- Lived on Auburn Avenue, known as "Black Wall Street" for its rich connections with Black businesses and churches
- In the summer of '44, before beginning post-secondary education at Morehouse College in Atlanta, King spent some time on a tobacco farm in Connecticut
	- There, he marveled at how the races coexisted peacefully outside the South, sparking a lifelong hatred of racial segregation
- At Morehouse College, president Benjamin Mays left a deep impression on King
	- Mays was a civil rights activist who had in the past criticized the African American community for its inaction in the face of oppression
- Spent next few years at Crozer Theological Seminary in Chester, Pennsylvania; there, he was exposed to Gandhi's philosophy of nonviolence
- Elected president of the student body there for his oratorical gifts, no small feat for a Black student in a predominantly white school

# Role in Montgomery Bus Boycott

Also see [[rosa-parks | Rosa Parks]].

- After completing his doctoral dissertation in theology from Boston U, King moved to Montgomery, Alabama and became pastor of the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church there
- Following Rosa Parks' arrest and the subsequent Montgomery Bus Boycott, King was elected president of the Montgomery Improvement Association
- As a result of this association, King was threatened and his house bombed, but remained a stalwart supporter of the cause

# Southern Christian Leadership Conference

- Capitalizing on the momentum of the Montgomery protests, King organized the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), giving him a platform from which he could address the nation
- Lectured all around the country and the globe
- In 1960, King moved back to Atlanta, where he became co-pastor of his father's church, the Ebenezer Baptist Church
- Arrested in October that year for protesting segregation in an Atlanta department store
- Though charges were quickly dropped, King was sentenced to a brief prison term on dubious pretenses, sparking national outrage
- This incident got King support from then-presidential candidate Kennedy, who would remain a supporter of King in his presidency; Pres. Johnson after him would do the same

# Birmingham protests

- In the spring of 1963, King campaigned along with local protestors to end segregation at lunch counters and in hiring practices, for which he was jailed
- Some of the white clergy (and even some of the black clergy) looked upon King's practices with disdain, reasoning that negotiation would be far more effective than protest
	- In response, King wrote an eloquent letter from the Birmingham jail in which he was imprisoned, stating:
	  > [!quote]
	  > You may well ask: “Why direct action? Why sit-ins, marches and so forth? Isn’t negotiation a better path?” You are quite right in calling for negotiation. Indeed, this is the very purpose of direct action. Nonviolent direct action seeks to create such a crisis and foster such a tension that a community which has constantly refused to negotiate is forced to confront the issue.	
- King helped organize the historic March on Washington
	- On August 28, 1963, he delivered the now-famous speech "I Have a Dream" in front of an audience of more than 200,000
- His efforts resulted in the passage of the Civil Rights Act in 1964; for this and other work, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in December of that year

# Conflict over nonviolent protest

- King's longstanding stance on nonviolent protest above all else led to clashes with younger Black civil rights activists, who increasingly labelled him as passive and old
- E.g., during the March 1965 demonstrations in Selma, Alabama, King unexpectedly turned back upon facing a barricade of state troopers to avoid bloodshed, raising suspicions that there had been an arrangement with federal and local authorities
- Malcolm X went as far as to say the following:
  > [!quote]
  >  Concerning nonviolence, it is criminal to teach a man not to defend himself when he is the constant victim of brutal attacks.

# Assassination

- On April 4, 1968, King was assassinated in Memphis, Tennessee while standing on the second-floor balcony of the hotel at which he was staying
- Caused riots around the country and the globe, leading Pres. Johnson to plead for Americans to "reject the blind violence" that had killed King
- The assassin, James Earl Ray, was promptly arrested and pled guilty to the murder on March 10, 1969

# Legacy

- King was and remains one of the most widely known African Americans leaders in history, having dedicated his life to the pursuit of racial equality in America
- His charisma and eloquence was without parallel and doubtless contributed to his popularity at the time
