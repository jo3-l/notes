# Background

- Harlem neighborhood in Manhattan intended to be for upper-class whites only, but eventually desperate landlords caved in and permitted Black families to move in
- 1910s and 1920s saw mass migration of Black workers in the South to the North, seeking better employment
- By 1920, ~300,000 African Americans had moved north; Harlem was popular destination for these new arrivals
- This led to the Harlem Renaissance: a period in which African Americans attempted to redefine their culture apart from white stereotypes
- Harlem Renaissance had a close relationship to civil rights, reform organizations, setting it apart from similar literary and artistic movements
	- Magazines like _The Crisis_ (published by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People); _Opportunity_ (published by the National Urban League) and _The Messenger_ were key parts of the movement
