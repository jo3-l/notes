# Background

- Harlem neighborhood in Manhattan intended to be for upper-class whites only, but eventually desperate landlords caved in and permitted Black families to move in
- 1910s and 1920s saw mass migration of Black workers in the South to the North, seeking better employment
- By 1920, ~300,000 African Americans had moved north; Harlem was popular destination for these new arrivals
- This led to the Harlem Renaissance: a "golden age in African American culture, manifesting in literature, music, stage performance and art"
